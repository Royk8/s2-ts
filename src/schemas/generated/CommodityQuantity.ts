 * ELECTRIC.POWER.L1: Electric power described in Watt on phase 1. If a device utilizes only one phase it should always use L1.
 * ELECTRIC.POWER.L2: Electric power described in Watt on phase 2. Only applicable for 3 phase devices.
 * ELECTRIC.POWER.L3: Electric power described in Watt on phase 3. Only applicable for 3 phase devices.
 * ELECTRIC.POWER.3_PHASE_SYMMETRIC: Electric power described in Watt on when power is equally shared among the three phases. Only applicable for 3 phase devices.
 * NATURAL_GAS.FLOW_RATE: Gas flow rate described in liters per second
 * HYDROGEN.FLOW_RATE: Gas flow rate described in grams per second
 * HEAT.TEMPERATURE: Heat described in degrees Celsius
 * HEAT.FLOW_RATE: Flow rate of heat carrying gas or liquid in liters per second
 * HEAT.THERMAL_POWER: Thermal power in Watt
 * OIL.FLOW_RATE: Oil flow rate described in liters per hour
